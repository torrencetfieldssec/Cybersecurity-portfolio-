# Cybersecurity-portfolio - Torrence Fields
---
This repository documents hands on cybersecurity, risk, incident response and Python projects I developed through academic coursework, certification training, and independent study. This repository largely emphasizes governance, risk, and compliance (GRC), operational security, and security documentation, which is also supported by hands on technical experience with Python based projects, IT systems, and security tooling.

I am a computer science graduate that shares a passionate interest in cybersecurity. My experience includes working in leadership roles, collaborating with large teams, and managing multiple projects simultaneously. I also bring strong problem solving and interpersonal skills, with a focus on promoting secure, well documented, and creating a reliable workplace environment.
